I have used heroku server to deploy my node js project Newsletter-signup

    STEPS TO DEPLOY ON HEROKU  
    -------------------------

1. download heroku CLI (command line interface) or ignore if already installed,and write below commands
   heroku --version
   heroku login

2. we need to change our port in app.listen() to process.env.PORT from local host(e.g.3000).
   process.env.PORT is a dynamic port that is defined by heroku .It allow
   us to work seemlessly with their system .

    process.evv.PORT || 3000  : in order to work our app both on heroku and local system 

3. create a file named Procfile and start the process by writing ( web : node app.js  )
    in order to tell heroku how to launch our app and which file contains our server code

4. next step to save our work to git 
    i) git init   : intitializes a brand new git repository
    ii) git add . 
    iii) git commit -m "first commit"

5. Now we have to create an new app on heroku by writing command :
   heroku create
    Now ,our brand new container/server is created at the address shown in blue color on terminal

6. command : git push heroku master
